## ✨ The Problem It Solves

Small retail shopkeepers in India often rely on manual, paper-based methods for their daily operations. This leads to several challenges:
* **Manual Bill Creation:** Writing bills by hand is slow, prone to errors, and unprofessional.
* **Tracking Daily `Hisab` (Accounts):** Manually tracking daily income and expenses is tedious and makes it difficult to understand the business's financial health.
* **Managing `Udhaar` (Credit):** Keeping track of customer credit on paper can lead to missed payments and financial losses.

**Vyapar Saathi** (meaning "Business Companion") is designed to solve these exact problems by providing a simple, digital, and powerful tool that requires no special training to use.
